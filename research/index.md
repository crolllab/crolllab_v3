# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research in our lab

Our lab is broadly interested in the evolutionary processes linked to adaptation of species and the composition of genomes. We attempt to span a wide range of scales, from population-level investigations to analyses covering large taxonomic groups. A primary focus is the threat of pathogens in agriculture. Genetic homogeneity of crop plants and antifungals drive rapid adaptive evolution in pathogen populations. We use a combination of genomics and experimental approaches to dissect adaptation, from the emergence of new pathogens to the evolution of fungicide resistance. We are also interested in the evolutionary processes that shape the composition of genomes, including the role of transposable elements and other selfish DNA sequences in genome evolution. Finally, we are passionate about applying conservation genomics to understand the evolutionary trajectory of endangered species.
