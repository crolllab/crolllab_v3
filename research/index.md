Many of the worldâ€™s staple crops are vulnerable to the emergence of new pathogens. Genetic homogeneity of crop plants and fungicide applications drive rapid adaptive evolution in pathogen populations. Our group investigates the genetic architecture of adaptive traits and retraces genome evolution in major crop pathogens.
