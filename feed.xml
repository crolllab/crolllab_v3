My name is Ghizlane, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Daniel Croll’s laboratory.</p>

<p>My scientific career began with a strong interest in understanding the genetic basis that makes a fungus pathogenic, how it infects its host and evades or manipulates the host immune response.</p>

<p>This interest led me to pursue my Master’s degree and PhD at the University of Murcia (Spain), where I focused on the molecular and cellular characterization of interactions between pathogenic fungi and their hosts. During my PhD, I discovered a strong passion for bioinformatics, which motivated me to complete a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics and opened the door to exploring the evolutionary mechanisms of basal fungi.</p>

<p>In the Croll lab, I aim to further consolidate my scientific career by studying the dynamics of transposable elements in the model organism <em>Zymoseptoria tritici</em> during wheat infection and under abiotic stress conditions.</p>

<p>Outside of science, I am passionate about baking, sports, languages, travelling, cinema, and everything related to Star Wars. I also deeply enjoy long walks with my nieces, spending time with good friends, and cherishing moments with my family.</p>

I am Carlos, a postdoctoral researcher who recently joined the Croll Lab. Born and raised in Tiñosa (Murcia), my scientific journey began in 2016 when I joined the Fungal Genomics and Molecular Biotechnology group at the University of Murcia (Spain) while completing my undergraduate studies in Biotechnology. Since then, I have been captivated by fungal genetics, particularly the study of early-diverging fungi (EDF). I completed both my Master’s (2018) and my PhD (2024) at the University of Murcia, where my research focused on unraveling the epigenetic mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation in these fascinating organisms.</p>

<p>As a postdoc in the Croll Lab, I will be diving into how epigenetic mechanisms impact the emergence of antifungal resistance in the major crop pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and exploring how transposable elements have shaped the genome evolution of early-diverging fungi.</p>

<p>Outside of the lab, I enjoy staying active through sports and supporting Real Madrid, watching Star Wars movies, reading philosophy, and spending quality time with my family.</p>

I am broadly interested in studying the evolution of pathogens and other host-microbe systems in a population-genomics framework.</p>

<p>My academic journey began at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali, where I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Biology, working on projects investigating host-pathogen interactions and sexual conflict in Drosophila melanogaster using experimental evolution. During my PhD at the University of Zurich, I used population genomics to study the evolution and epidemiology of the fungal plant pathogen Blumeria graminis.</p>

<p>At the Croll Lab, my current project focuses on using genomics to study the co-invasion dynamics of ambrosia beetles and their mutualistic fungi.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading, dancing and exploring new cuisines.</p>

My academic background, while centered on biology, is quite diverse. I hold a bachelor’s degree in cell biology specialized in phylogeny and bioinformatics and a master’s degree in health biology specialized in microscopy.</p>

<p>I have always been drawn to computational aspects and imaging in biology rather than animal biology, and I’m delighted to finally be able to apply them in my thesis!</p>

<p>Today, I have the opportunity to work on a subject with complex regulatory and scientific challenges: the detection and control of <em>Brassica napus</em> organisms modified by new genome editing techniques.</p>

<p>What deeply motivates me is the concrete impact of my research on food traceability and the control of transgenic crops. Managing large volumes of data and solving complex analytical problems constitute a real intellectual challenge for me.</p>

<p>Beyond the laboratory, I love hiking and I’m interested in medicinal plants as well as tree identification. Combining the plant world with bioinformatics was therefore a perfect choice for my thesis project!</p>
