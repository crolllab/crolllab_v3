      <p data-search="Blog post written by Sandra Milena Gonzalez Sayer  visiting PhD student from Colombia One of my biggest passions is facing challenges related to molecular pattern discovery   Ever since I was doing my undergraduate program  I have been interested in understanding the pathogen role in plant disease and the molecular component in the pathogenicity process  My study model since that time has been Pseudocercospora ulei  an ascomycete biotrophic pathogenic fungus that causes a disease known as the South American Leaf Blight  SALB  in natural rubber plants  Hevea brasiliensis   Because of P  ulei s biotrophic lifestyle  the isolation and in vitro culture has been one of the biggest challenges studying this pathogen  The obtention of P  ulei isolates from infected leaves could take up to 50 days  but once it occurs  maintaining the strains alive becomes another challenge  The common practice to preserve them is through periodic transference to fresh medium  However  it is well known that this practice can affect the isolates genetic stability and generate phenotypic changes like the loss of pathogenicity  In my undergraduate thesis  I assessed long term preservation methods to maintain the P  ulei strains collection  As a result  I standardized conidia lyophilization conditions which allow maintaining the P  ulei isolations viability for more than one year H  brasiliensis is a perennial species which presents an unproductive period of approximately six years  Because of that  plant breeding programs advance slowly  and unconventional genetic breeding strategies based on genetic engineering technics are still necessary  Aware that molecular knowledge is crucial to improving plant breeding programs and before to its draft genome release  I worked in searching for polymorphic molecular markers  Microsatellites and RAPDs  for discriminating a natural rubber population constituted by Asiatic and Latin American clones  These markers were used in a national service of H  brasiliensis varieties identification whose aim was organizing the clonal gardens that produce seedlings for future rubber plantations in Colombia  In this sense  the farmers could know the identity of the planted clones  SALB resistance or highly rubber yield clones  before the economic investment during the unproductive period My scientific career has been developed in the natural rubber group from the biotechnology institute of the National University of Colombia  The work of this group is focused on studying the natural rubber crop since a holistic perspective encompassing the pre and post cultivate stages as well as the productive period  It has been amazing to me having the opportunity to choose my research line through this integral view  so my decision was studying the SALB disease  Currently  I am doing my PhD studying the P  ulei pathogenicity mechanisms through genomic and transcriptomic perspective  The main goal of my thesis project is to improve the knowledge of P  ulei genome architecture and identify pathogenicity determinants deployed by this fungus to cause SALB disease  For this purpose  whole genome shotgun sequencing and assembly of the P  ulei genome was done using Pacific BioScience  Oxford nanopore  and Illumina platforms  One of my more relevant findings is the P  ulei size genome is the biggest genome so far reported in the Mycosphaerellaceae family  Furthermore  this genome showed an exceptionally high repeat content that could be associated with a genome a size expansion event and could play an essential role in the environment fungal adaptation as well in the pathogenicity mechanism evolved      Back to all blogs">

      <p data-search="Blog post written by Luzia Stalder who started her PhD in our lab in spring 2019 Understanding how characteristics of organisms arise and interact with each other   this is the fundamental aim of biological research  As researchers  we want to unveil the complex relationships between physiological  molecular and genetic traits  Importantly  these relationships evolved in a highly branched network  Thus  to untangle complex relationships  we need to be able to measure a large set of variables at different levels simultaneously  For example  to understand the virulence of a pathogen on a host  we require knowledge of genomes of pathogen strains with different virulence  and test how these affect different hosts  which themselves are in different environments and inhabit different microbes  I believe that large datasets with information collections at different levels   together with modern bioinformatic tools   are key to uncover complex relationships of biological networks in a systematic manner Since I started to work on biological questions  I was fascinated how new meaningful relationships are revealed using large datasets  During my master studies at ETH Zurich  I extracted complex relationships from high throughput genomic  transcriptomic   and proteomic data  In my first project  I used genomic data collected around the world with 114 populations of Rhynchosporium commune  a major fungal pathogen of barley  to understand how genomic changes influence its adaptation to fungicide  For my second project  I used transcriptomic datasets of hippocampal brain tissue of mice that have been subjected to either a stressful or a non stressful situation  to understand how stress influences the expression network of different hippocampal regions  In a third project  I used large proteomic datasets of yeast  fly  mouse and human to understand how basic protein networks evolve across evolution For my PhD project  I joined the lab of Daniel Croll at the University of Neuchâtel  to focus on the complex microbiome network that influences plant health and disease  Typically  researchers study pathogen  host interactions in an isolated one pathogen   one host system  However  it has been shown that the presence of a second microbe on the host plant can either aid the arriving pathogen in a way that it becomes far more virulent   or on the contrary  can prevent the arriving pathogen from infecting the plant completely  One prominent example of such microbes are Pseudomonas bacteria  which are omnipresent on plant leaves and roots  Different Pseudomonas species either promote or inhibit fungal pathogen growth  and therefore significantly affect plant disease  I am intrigued by such microbe microbe interactions and their impact on plant health  I hope to untangle a part of this complex interplay in the coming years  For this  I will focus on the tripartite system of wheat  the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici   the major pathogen of wheat   and the bacteria Pseudomonas  I want to understand how the diverse bacteria fungal interactions affect plant health on a genetic and functional level  I will use high throughput genomic and transcriptomic approaches to do so  My ultimate goal is to understand complex relationships that can be used for sustainable crop production in the first place  but also allow to draw parallels to complex microbiome systems in human Back to all blogs">
