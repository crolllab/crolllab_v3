Jigisha joined the lab in December 2025 as a SNSF postdoctoral fellow. 

Jigisha is an evolutionary biologist interested in using population genomics to address fundamental questions in host-microbe systems. She graduated with a Masters in Biology from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali and then moved to the University of Zurich in 2021 for her PhD where she studied the population genomics and molecular epidemiology of cereal powdery mildew in Europe. In the Croll lab, she will be using population genomics to study co-invasion dynamics of the invasive ambrosia beetle and its symbiont ambrosia fungi.
