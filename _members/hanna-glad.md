Hanna is a bioinformatician and evolutionary biologist with particular interest in the application of computational methods to answer biological questions. She received a B.Sc in Biology from the University of Neuch√¢tel (CH), and an M.Sc in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from the joint program of the Universities of Fribourg and Bern (CH). Ongoing research interests include understanding how regulatory non-coding RNAs contribute to adaptive processes in pathogenic fungi, as well as the application of computer-vision and machine-learning techniques to better understand the genetic determinants of phenotypic variation in microscopic pathogens.
