Hanna is a bioinformatician and evolutionary biologist with particular interest in the application of computational methods to answer biological questions. She received a B.Sc in Biology from the University of Neuchâtel (CH), and an M.Sc in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from the joint program of the Universities of Fribourg and Bern (CH). Ongoing research interests include understanding how regulatory non-coding RNAs contribute to adaptive processes in pathogenic fungi, as well as the application of computer-vision and machine-learning techniques to better understand the genetic determinants of phenotypic variation in microscopic pathogens.
