I am a computational evolutionary biologist passionate about selfish element and virus evolution. I got my Bachelor and Master degree at Moscow State University, Russia in 2016-2022. I started my PhD project in Neuchatel in 2022, and I am focusing on fungal mitochondrial genome evolution, which are extremely variable in genome size and gene content. I am investigating mitogenome diversity and genome rearrangements both at the kingdom and population levels, with an attempt to connect fungal genomic and ecological features. Fascinating for me, the bursts of mitochondrial genomes sizes were caused by the reproduction of different selfish elements: semi-spliced introns, homing endonucleases, and even reverse transcriptases.
