Ivan Skakov is a computational evolutionary biologist studying the evolution of selfish elements and viruses. He completed his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at Moscow State University between 2016 and 2022 before starting his PhD at the University of Neuchâtel in 2022. His research focuses on the evolution of fungal mitochondrial genomes at both the kingdom and population levels. He is also interested in the broader evolution of selfish elements, as well as the applications of pangenome graphs in comparative genomics, structural variant discovery, and ancient DNA research. Beyond studies, he finds peace in the mountains, a thrill in traveling the world, and inspiration in the timeless beauty of Romanesque architecture.
