Ivan Skakov is a computational evolutionary biologist interested in host-parasite interactions, endosymbiosis, and the evolution of selfish elements. He completed his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at Moscow State University between 2016 and 2022 before starting his PhD at the University of Neuchâtel in 2022. His research focuses on the evolution of fungal mitochondrial genomes at both the kingdom and population levels. In addition to studying genetic conflict, he explores the potential of pangenome graphs to better represent genomic diversity and structural variation in comparative genomics. He is also interested in ancient DNA as a tool for reconstructing evolutionary histories. Beyond research, he finds peace in the mountains, a thrill in traveling the world, and inspiration in the timeless beauty of Romanesque architecture.
