Emile Gluck-Thaler is a mycologist and evolutionary biologist interested in understanding how organisms adapt to changing ecological contexts. He received a B.Sc. in Life Sciences and Microbiology from McGill University in 2014, and a Ph.D. in Plant Pathology from the Ohio State University in 2019. He then went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pittsburgh in the Department of Biological Sciences from 2019-2020 and at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Biology from 2020-2021. His ongoing research interests involve determining the genetic bases of adaptation in plant-associated fungi, and evaluating how selection across environments impacts the evolution of genes and genomes.

Emile started as an Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in September 2023.
