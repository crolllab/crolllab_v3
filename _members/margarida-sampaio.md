Ana Margarida Sampaio is a Plant Biologist interested in plant-pathogen interactions. She completed her PhD in Plant Sciences at Nova University of Lisbon (Portugal) in 2021, where she investigated resistance mechanisms of legume species to soilborne pathogens. Her current research focuses on the evolution of fungal effectors, aiming to better understand how they evolve to evade host recognition. To explore this, she primarly works with _Zymoseptoria tritici_ and _Magnaporthe oryzae_ pathosystems.
