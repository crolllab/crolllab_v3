Ghizlane Tahiri is a biotechnologist with a strong interest in understanding the interactions between fungi and their hosts. Her research has focused on the regulation of gene expression mediated by RNA interference and long non-coding RNAs during interactions between human pathogenic fungi and different animal models.

After completing her Master’s degrees in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics (2019, 2024) and PhD (2023) from the University of Murcia (Spain), she joined Croll’s group in Neuchâtel as a postdoctoral researcher. In this group, her work focuses on understanding the dynamics of transposable elements in response to infection and abiotic stress.

Ghizlane joined the lab in February 2026 as a SNSF postdoctoral fellow.
