Sabina M. Tralamazza is a plant pathologist and evolutionary biologist. She received her B.Sc in Biology in 2009 from the Federal University of Paraná State in Brazil and her Ph.D. in Science in 2015 from São Paulo University, Brazil. She integrates genome-scale, population genomics, and molecular biology to understand genome evolution and uncover fungal pathogen adaptative traits associated with crop diseases. She is also interested in pathogen metabolism evolution and its impact on food security.

Sabina joined us for postdoctoral research 2018-2024.
