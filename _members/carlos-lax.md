Carlos Lax is a fungal biologist interested in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of fungal biology. His research has focused on epigenetic mechanisms and evolutionary drivers of genome architecture. He is also passionate about the development and application of molecular biology tools for the detailed study of gene expression regulation. After obtaining his Master’s and PhD from the University of Murcia, Carlos moved to Neuchâtel for his postdoctoral training. In the Croll Lab, he focuses on understanding how epigenetic regulation contributes to antifungal resistance in plant pathogens.

Carlos joined the lab in February 2026 as a postdoctoral fellow.
