Thomas Badet is a Maître-Assistant teaching plant pathology at the University of Neuchâtel. His current research in the lab aims at better understanding the evolution of genome architecture with a focus on transposable elements in fungi. For that he implements predictive biology frameworks in the context of quantitative genetics and genome evolution. Thomas’ additional interests span the evolution of Repeat-Induced Point mutations as a fungal-specific mechanism of transposon control, but also the impact of non-coding and synonymous mutations on expression variation and metabolic modelling in the context of fungicide resistance.
