Toby Baril is a bioinformatician and evolutionary biologist interested in the evolution of transposable elements (TEs) and their impacts in host genomes. He graduated with an MBiochem from the University of Southampton in 2018, followed by a PhD in evolutionary genetics from the University of Exeter in 2022. His ongoing research interests involve comparative studies to explore TE-host evolutionary dynamics among populations of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, and the creation of new tools for improved TE curation and annotation, including the development of the Earl Grey TE annotation pipeline.
