Daniel Croll is a Professor of Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Neuch창tel, Switzerland and has a broad range of interests ranging from population genomics, microbiology, bioinformatics and conservation genomics.

The major aims of Daniel's research are to understand the evolutionary processes that shape the genomes of fungi and plant pathogens in particular. The motivation is to understand how pathogens evolve to cause disease. For this, the lab focuses on major crop pathogens and investigates mechanisms of rapid adaptation. Daniel takes a broad view of his research and has strong interests in evolutionary processes at all levels from transposable elements to genomes and broad species comparisons. The lab has also a passion for projects related to conservation genomics. Daniel's approach combines computational work with empirical analyses from the field to the bench.
