Mélanie holds a bachelor's degree in cell biology with a specialization in phylogeny and bioinformatics, as well as a master's degree in health biology specialized in microscopy, both completed in France. In 2024, she had the opportunity to undertake her first-year master's internship in the evolutionary genetics laboratory, where she contributed to research on mutations responsible for fungicide resistance in _Zymoseptoria tritici_, a major wheat pathogen.

In September 2025, she began her PhD focused on the detection of genetically modified oilseed rape plants on a global scale — an important contribution in the framework of revising legislation on genetically modified organisms.

Beyond the laboratory, she enjoys hiking and has a keen interest in medicinal plants as well as tree identification
