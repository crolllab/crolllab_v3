Sam Horsfield is a postdoctoral researcher, specialising in computational pangenomic analysis. Sam graduated from the University of Birmingham in 2018 with an MSci in biochemistry, before working for Illumina UK, where he developed reagents for high-throughput sequencing platforms. Sam then completed an MSc in biomedical sciences at Imperial College London, staying to pursue a PhD in bacterial genomics, during which he developed tools for analysing pangenomes of bacterial pathogens. Sam graduated from his PhD in 2023 and joined the Lees group at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) as a postdoctoral fellow, where he developed likelihood-free and deep-learning approaches for epidemiological analysis of bacterial species. Sam joined the Croll group in 2026, where his research is focused on development of rapid pangenome-based tools to identify diversifying regions in fungal genomes, which are drivers of adaptation to a pathogenic lifestyle.
