Alice Laigle is an evolutionary biologist and bioinformatician interested in epigenomics and how the 3D structure of the chromatin influences gene expression during adaptation and/or plant-pathogen interactions. She achieved her M.Sc. in Plant Biology at the University of Paris-Saclay (2021) and a second one in Bioinformatics for Biologists at the University of Nantes (2022). She started a Ph.D. to better understand how the genomic 3D architecture of a fungus can influence its efficiency during infection.
