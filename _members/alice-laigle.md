Alice Laigle is an evolutionary biologist and bioinformatician interested in nuclei, epigenetics and 3D genome organization. She completed her M.Sc. in Plant Biology at the University of Paris-Saclay (FR; 2021) and a second one in Bioinformatics for Biologists at the University of Nantes (FR; 2022).  Since she started her PhD, she is  focusing her research on the 3D genome architecture of fungi and its impact at the evolution’s and host-pathogen’s levels. During her free time, she climbs and hikes, but also paints and sketches what she learns.
