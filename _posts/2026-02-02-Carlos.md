Hello! I am Carlos, a postdoctoral researcher who recently joined the Croll Lab. Born and raised in Tiñosa (Murcia), my scientific journey began in 2016 when I joined the Fungal Genomics and Molecular Biotechnology group at the University of Murcia (Spain) while completing my undergraduate studies in Biotechnology. Since then, I have been captivated by fungal genetics, particularly the study of early-diverging fungi (EDF). I completed both my Master’s (2018) and my PhD (2024) at the University of Murcia, where my research focused on unraveling the epigenetic mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation in these fascinating organisms.

As a postdoc in the Croll Lab, I will be diving into how epigenetic mechanisms impact the emergence of antifungal resistance in the major crop pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and exploring how transposable elements have shaped the genome evolution of early-diverging fungi.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy staying active through sports and supporting Real Madrid, watching Star Wars movies, reading philosophy, and spending quality time with my family.
