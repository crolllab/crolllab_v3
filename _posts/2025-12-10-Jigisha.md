Hi, I’m Jigisha and I recently joined the group as a postdoc. I am broadly interested in studying the evolution of pathogens and other host-microbe systems in a population-genomics framework.

My academic journey began at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali, where I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Biology, working on projects investigating host-pathogen interactions and sexual conflict in Drosophila melanogaster using experimental evolution. During my PhD at the University of Zurich, I used population genomics to study the evolution and epidemiology of the fungal plant pathogen Blumeria graminis.

At the Croll Lab, my current project focuses on using genomics to study the co-invasion dynamics of ambrosia beetles and their mutualistic fungi.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, dancing and exploring new cuisines.
