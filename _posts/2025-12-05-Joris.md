I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Evolutionary Genomics of Pathogens group at the University of Neuchâtel. I completed my BSc and MSc in Plant Sciences at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, specialising in plant pathology. During this time, I contributed to several projects on Panama disease in banana caused by _Fusarium oxysporum_. After graduating, I moved to Switzerland to pursue a PhD at the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), where I investigated anthracnose disease in white lupin caused by _Colletotrichum lupini_. Following my PhD, I spent one and a half years in industry supporting onion breeding programmes. I then joined the University of Oxford at Magdalen College for my first postdoctoral position, focusing on the evolutionary genomics of _Colletotrichum_ species infecting strawberry, historical genomics, and the development of RNAi-based crop protection strategies. In my current project, I work on the genomics and control of _Botrytis cinerea_, the causal agent of grey mould in numerous crops. I am constructing a high-quality global pangenome with an emphasis on grapevine-infecting strains to better understand the evolution of notorious pathogen.
