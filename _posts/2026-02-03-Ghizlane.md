Hi! My name is Ghizlane, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Daniel Croll’s laboratory.	

My scientific career began with a strong interest in understanding the genetic basis that makes a fungus pathogenic, how it infects its host and evades or manipulates the host immune response.

This interest led me to pursue my Master’s degree and PhD at the University of Murcia (Spain), where I focused on the molecular and cellular characterization of interactions between pathogenic fungi and their hosts. During my PhD, I discovered a strong passion for bioinformatics, which motivated me to complete a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics and opened the door to exploring the evolutionary mechanisms of basal fungi.

In the Croll lab, I aim to further consolidate my scientific career by studying the dynamics of transposable elements in the model organism _Zymoseptoria tritici_ during wheat infection and under abiotic stress conditions.

Outside of science, I am passionate about baking, sports, languages, travelling, cinema, and everything related to Star Wars. I also deeply enjoy long walks with my nieces, spending time with good friends, and cherishing moments with my family.
