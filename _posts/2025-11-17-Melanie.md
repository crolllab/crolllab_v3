Hello, I'm Mélanie, a PhD student in bioinformatics at the Evolutionary Genetics Laboratory in Neuchâtel. My academic background, while centered on biology, is quite diverse. I hold a bachelor's degree in cell biology specialized in phylogeny and bioinformatics and a master's degree in health biology specialized in microscopy.

I have always been drawn to computational aspects and imaging in biology rather than animal biology, and I'm delighted to finally be able to apply them in my thesis!

Today, I have the opportunity to work on a subject with complex regulatory and scientific challenges: the detection and control of _Brassica napus_ organisms modified by new genome editing techniques.

What deeply motivates me is the concrete impact of my research on food traceability and the control of transgenic crops. Managing large volumes of data and solving complex analytical problems constitute a real intellectual challenge for me.

Beyond the laboratory, I love hiking and I'm interested in medicinal plants as well as tree identification. Combining the plant world with bioinformatics was therefore a perfect choice for my thesis project!
